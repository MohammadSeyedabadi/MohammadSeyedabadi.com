// To explain what is going on here, we'll start with the import statement. We are importing our clientPromise method from the lib/mongodb file. This file contains all the instructions on how to connect to our MongoDB Atlas cluster. Additionally, within this file, we cache the instance of our connection so that subsequent requests do not have to reconnect to the cluster. They can use the existing connection. All of this is handled for you!
